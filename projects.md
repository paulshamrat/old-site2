Here is a non-exhaustive list of my Research projects.

01. Physicochemical role and potential inhibitor screening for the candidate biomarkers overexpressed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice <br>
Host: Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology<br>
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj 8100, Bangladesh <br>
Advisor: Mahbub Hasan, PhD & Manoj Mandal<br>
2021-2022

02. Microarray Data Analysis Using GEO2R to Identify Differentially Expressed Genes in Ovarian Cancer after NSC319726 Treatment and Pathway Analysis<br>
Prof. D Karunagaran's Cancer Biology Lab, Dept. of Biotechnology.
Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 6000636, Tamil Nadu, India<br>
Mar 2020- Sep 2020


03. Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Molecular Docking & Data analysis
In this project I am keeping a record of essential resources, workplan and updates on python programming used in data analysis of molecular dynamics simulation and NGS data as well. 

04. Digital Illustration for Biology
Depicting a complex biological phenomenon in the form of flowchart, pathway and logical figure, becomes a popular way to present scientific information. I mostly used Inkscape and GIMP for the generation of biological illustrations. Here I track record of these works.
