### Hello!

My name is Shamrat - biochemsitry MS student at BSMRSTU, Gopalganj 8100, Banlgadesh. Currently, I am working on molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation study of proteins associates with EAE: a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis under the supervision of [Mahbub Hasan, PhD](https://sites.google.com/view/mahbub-hasan/home). My MS thesis project has been funded by NST grant from the ministry of science and technology, people's republic of Bangladesh.

In summer 2020, I worked on DEGs analysis from ovarian cancer datasets as a research intern at the cancer biology lab, dept. of biotechnology, IIT Madras, India with GRIESHMA fellowship under the supervision of [Professor Karuanagaran D](https://biotech.iitm.ac.in/Faculty/Karunagaran/index.php). Apart from this I was jointly awarded the 2nd runner up award at the BAUET Tech Fair 2K18 at BAUET natore for the outstanding presentation on my DFT and Molecular Docking study on Delafloxaci against ABSSI.

Apart from research, I love to sketch, do check my graphite on papers [here](), whilst great fan of classical detective stories - Sherlock Holmes, Feluda and many more. In my off-research time I love to teach biology to the kids at my village where I show them the fun experiments of diy dna extraction, glowing plants and perspective biochemistry in our daily lives.
