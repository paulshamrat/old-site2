# Hello!

I am Shamrat - Biochemsitry MS student at BSMRSTU, Gopalganj, Banlgadesh. Currently, I am concentrating on molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation study of proteins associates with EAE: a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis under the supervision of [Mahbub Hasan, PhD](https://sites.google.com/view/mahbub-hasan/home). My MS thesis project recieved NST grant from the ministry of science and technology, people's republic of Bangladesh.

In summer 2020, I worked on DEGs analysis from ovarian cancer datasets as a research intern at the Cancer Biology Lab, Dept. of Biotechnology, IIT Madras, India with GRIESHMA fellowship under the supervision of [Professor Karuanagaran D](https://biotech.iitm.ac.in/Faculty/Karunagaran/index.php). I secured a joint 2nd runner up position at the BAUET Tech Fair 2K18 at BAUET natore for the outstanding presentation on my DFT and Molecular Docking study on Delafloxacin against ABSSI.

Apart from research, I love to sketch, do check my graphite on papers [here](), whilst great fan of classical detective stories - Sherlock Holmes, Feluda and many more. In my off-research time, I love to teach biology to the kids at my village where I show them the fun experiments of DIY DNA extraction, glowing plants and perspective biochemistry in our daily lives.

# Projects
01. **MSProject**: Physicochemical role and potential inhibitor screening for the candidate biomarkers overexpressed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. <br>
Host: Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj 8100, Bangladesh <br>
Advisor: Mahbub Hasan, PhD & Manoj Mandal. 2021-2022

02. **DEGSAnalsis**: Microarray Data Analysis Using GEO2R to Identify Differentially Expressed Genes in Ovarian Cancer after NSC319726 Treatment and Pathway Analysis<br>
Prof. D Karunagaran's Cancer Biology Lab, Dept. of Biotechnology.
Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 6000636, Tamil Nadu, India.
Mar 2020- Sep 2020

03. **MMMD**: Molecular Modeling, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Molecular Docking & Data analysis
In this project I am keeping a record of essential resources, workplan and updates on python programming used in data analysis of molecular dynamics simulation and NGS data as well. 

04. **CODESEQ**: Learning tools like- Python, R, Ruby, HTML, illustration and other assets to give support my projects
Depicting a complex biological phenomenon in the form of flowchart, pathway and logical figure, becomes a popular way to present scientific information. I mostly used Inkscape and GIMP for the generation of biological illustrations. Here I track record of these works.
